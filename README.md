# MyBlockchain

Repo in which I create my own blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contracts for learning purposes.

If you want to run, you need to:
* have 'npm' installed 
* npm install prompt-sync
* npm install sha256
* run "node Testing.js"

Blockchain:
* Proof-of-work method used
* Genesis block uses Date.now() as timestamp for learning purposes
* The transactions are simulated (I create them myself from the code)

/* THE ONLY THING THAT MIGHT DIFFER
FROM A NORMAL BLOCKCHAIN ARE HOW THE TRANSACTIONS ARE RECEIVED,
SINCE THE TRANSACTIONS WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM THE SERVER.

IN OUR CODE, AS I DON'T HAVE A SERVER, I'LL MAKE
THE TRANSACTIONS FROM COMMAND LINE */
